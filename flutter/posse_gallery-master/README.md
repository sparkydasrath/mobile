Welcome to the **Flutter Gallery**. This project serves to provide a walkthrough of Flutter's capabilities and to showcase Flutter's key features in a single, exciting package.

This project is **work in progress**. The current supported Flutter gallery is available [here](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/master/examples/flutter_gallery).

# Getting Started

Currently the only way to obtain the application is to build it yourself. To do so, following the steps in this section.

You will need some basic knowledge of the Flutter toolset and building for mobile devices in general. For help getting started with Flutter, view our online [documentation](http://flutter.io/).

## Installing Flutter

To install Flutter, follow the steps [here](https://flutter.io/setup/). It is highly suggested that you install IntelliJ also if you're planning to do any active development in Flutter.

## Running the app

After installing Flutter and verifying it works by running `flutter doctor`, you can run the Gallery application by executing the `flutter run` command from the directory containing the project Flutter code.

**Note:** you will need to have a running iOS simulator, Android emulator or attached device that is recognizable (and listed) in the result output of running `flutter doctor`. If you don't Flutter won't know where to install the application.

# Issues

Please feel free to log any issues you find using the project issue tracker. We will work to respond as soon as possible.

# About

This is project a collaboration with [Posse](http://goposse.com/) to design and build an updated Flutter gallery application to better showcase Flutter's key features.

This is an in-progress effort and should not be taken as best-practice example Flutter code at this time.
